    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>I am a nineteen year old student who is currently attending Simon Fraser University. This is my second year in the
       Computing Science program, and I live locally in Coquitlam. Some fun facts about
       me include that I have a dog, I was born in the states, and I enjoy reading books in my spare time.
