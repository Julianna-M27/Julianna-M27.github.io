        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>
       
        I have experience working in a customer service position for three years. In this position, I was trusted with closing the store and locking up anything valuable.
        As well, I have cooked in an industry-grade kitchen which gave me experience operating in a high-stress environment. Lastly, I have built a functional dungeon crawler video game in Python.
